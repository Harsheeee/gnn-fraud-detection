## Overview
This project implements a graph-based fraud detection pipeline using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify anomalous or fraudulent entities by leveraging relational structure in transactional data.
Unlike traditional tabular models, this approach explicitly models user–transaction interactions as a graph, enabling better detection of coordinated or hidden fraud patterns.
